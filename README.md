# _{TH-jQuery_Basics-Lightbox}_

#### _{Create a Lightbox for pictures}, {10/16/2016}_

#### By _**{Chris Underwood}**_

## Description

_{Instead of having images open up in a URL that is confusing for the users, this creates a program called a lightbox that contains the image. The image is loaded in a lightbox when the using clicks on the thumb nail and is closed again when the user clicks on the lightbox. The lightbox is full screen and is opaque enough for the user to see that the webpage they came from is underneath the image.}_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Download the files and go to the index.html in your browser of choice. An internet connection may be required as jQuery is being loaded from a CDN.
